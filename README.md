# Behold, the Quantum Even Checker.
State of the art, quantum physics and string theory powered, neurons fired, Albert Einstien devourer, the Quantum Even Checker. With our quantum physics (developed by me), you will be able
to check if a number is even or odd! This took approximately 5,671 days to write, and had me paying 12,600 dollars a MONTH just for electricity. But it's all to demonstrate the power, the agility, 
THE SPEED of the Quantum Even Checker. 
# The story you
Written in Brainfuck, 69,420 lines of code later, plus 5 felony charges, we present the Quantum Even Checker. Up until now, we had to use `random.randchoice([True, False])` to determine
if numbers where even, but that junk is spyware, as Terry Davis would say. But behold, the Quantum Even Checker, comes in, our state of the art, blazingly fast, developed with Fireship's neurons,
we present the Quantum Even Checker. Not slow, yes fast. Not spyware, yes Quantum Even Checker. Thank you for all the supporters who've sent me Uranium-235, because if not I wouldn't have made the 
Uranium-235-powered-if-statement! Powered with the power of Kai Cenat and Ohio, we present the Quantum Even Checker!! The fastest, most robust, Uranium-235 powered-if-statement-logic, utilizing
69 cores of an NVidia GPU! 

# Uranium-235 + greatness = Quantum Even Checker;
